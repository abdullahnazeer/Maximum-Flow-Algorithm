After comparison and judgement between all the algorithms related to the calculation of Maximum Flow, I have decided to
proceed with the algorithm developed by L.R Ford, Jr. & D.R Fulkerson.

In my opinion, the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm seems to have a short running time and the determination of the Maximum Flow is very fast 
and accurate.

I have also reviewed the algorithm produced by Ahuja & Orlin and have compared its running time with that of the Fulkerson one.
In conclusion, I have deduced that the Fulkerson algorithm excels the Orlin algorithm in terms of performance and efficiency.
